# SQL Improvement Logic Test
SQL Improvement Logic Test which is related to SQL query performance optimization.

## Tip 1: Avoid Like Expressions With Leading Wildcards (%)
The predicate LIKE '%キャビンアテンダン' causes full table scan. 

## Tip 2: Take Advantage of MySQL Full-Text Searches
If you are faced with a situation where you need to search data using wildcards and you don't want your database to underperform, you should consider using MySQL full-text search (FTS) because it is far much faster than queries using wildcard characters

## Tip 3: Index All Columns Used in 'where', 'order by', 'left join', 'inner join', and 'group by' Clauses
MySQL allows you to index database tables, making it possible to quickly seek to records without performing a full table scan first and thus significantly speeding up query execution. 

## Tip 4: Avoid OR conditions
The reason will be the connection between the two conditions - the OR operator, which makes the database fetch the results of each part of the condition separately.
An alternative way to look at this query can be to use Full-Text Searches

## Tip 5:Avoid sorting with a mixed order
MySQL (and so many other relational databases), cannot use indexes when sorting with a mixed order (both ASC and DESC in the same ORDER BY clause). This changed with the release of the reversed indexes functionality and MySQL 8.x.
